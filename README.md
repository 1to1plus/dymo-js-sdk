# Dymo JS framework

## Developer notes

* clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:1to1plus/dymo-js-sdk.git`
* install dev dependencies `yarn install`
* run tests with `yarn test`

## PLEASE NOTE

This project is not complete yet. I'm creating test and tweaking the code to do what it needs to do still.

My adoption of https://github.com/dymosoftware/dymo-connect-framework

## Roadmap

* re-build the dymo object in ./src/dymo/index.js from the updated structure
* test the framework
* build examples
